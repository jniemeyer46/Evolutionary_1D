\section*{\begin{center}MOEA Explained\end{center}}

For my MOEA I decided that my Pareto Fronts would be based off the first objective fitness vs. the second objective fitness.  Since we did not care about the lower fitness fronts, I was able to ignore any Pareto Fronts that were below P1 (the best Pareto Front so far).  This means that i had to use a temp list when I found a new dominant Pareto Front due to having to remove the previous dominant Pareto Front "king," which i did by going through the current Pareto Front and seeing if the older values work with the newer dominant front.  If it does I added it to the temp list (which already contained the newest dominant Pareto Front), when finished with going through the previous best Pareto Front I deepcopy the temp list to P1 and the temp list becomes the new Best Pareto Front.

\section*{\begin{center} Investigation \end{center}}

The trade-off between the best Pareto Front and the diversity of the obtained Pareto Front for all of my datasets would be that the generated solutions are extremely clustered... In fact, there are a lot of overlaps between the points within these Pareto Fronts.  This is due to the extremely small change in the second objective fitness, which forces them to cluster closer together, even if the first objective fitness is extremely spread-out.  

Overall my datasets for each problem were fairly close together in the end, meaning that the results were very loosely tied to the strategy parameters.  There was no a clear winner throughout all of my datasets which means that I needed to change a parameter in order to get a better set of results and I failed to do so.
